# CleverKTitles
Ever wanted to display on screen messages to players when they get a kill?

CleverKTitles makes that possible!

So far, when a player gets a kill, you can:

Display an on screen Title Message
Display an on screen subtitle Message
The plugin recognises all kill types, including crystals and explosions, so this is a must for any crystal pvp server!

Features:

Full Minecraft Colour code support! (&b, &c etc.)
Per player toggle mode! (/ckt toggle)
Full message configurability! (config.yml file)
Titles and Subtitle messages
Reloadable! (/ckt reload)
Registers all kill types! (melee, fall, explosions, crystals, etc)
Made and tested for versions 1.17 through to 1.20.4
All current features are bug tested, but if you do find a bug, just DM me on discord: noodleman2839

Features planned to be added:

Action Bar messages
HEX Colour Code support
Enable and disabled worlds
Permission for toggling kill titles
Commands:

/ckt help : Displays all commands

/ckt toggle : Toggles titles on or off

/ckt reload : Reloads and syncs the config.yml file with the plugin without having to restart the server.

Permissions: cleverktiles.reload
